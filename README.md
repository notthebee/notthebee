Hi! My name is Wolfgang and I do a lot of DevOps and Ansible stuff (IaC, roles, playbooks, Docker, etc.).

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/WolfgangsChannel) where I make videos about technology, home servers, self-hosting and other stuff.

You can follow me on [Mastodon](https://tilde.zone/@notthebee) or support my projects on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/WolfgangsChannel)
