Hi! My name is Wolfgang and I do a lot of DevOps and Ansible stuff (IaC, roles, playbooks, Docker, etc.). 

My biggest project is the [home server Ansible playbook](https://github.com/notthebee/infra), which is supposed to set up my entire homelab infrastructure from scratch, but is currently rewritten too often to be of any use 😁

I also maintain [ansible-easy-vpn](https://github.com/notthebee/ansible-easy-vpn), which lets you set up a Wireguard server with reasonable security and 2FA from scratch on a cloud VM of your choice.

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/WolfgangsChannel) where I make videos about technology, home servers, self-hosting and other stuff.

You can follow me on [Mastodon](https://tilde.zone/@notthebee) or support my projects on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/WolfgangsChannel)
